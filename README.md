This repository contains various scripts to automate live reading for several people. For example, to split the text into chunks of approximately equal sizes.

# Usage

To use the scripts you need to paste the contents of [main.js](./main.js) file into your browser's console.

There are various configurations in that script code that you may want to tweak.

* `offset` - Amount of words to skip from the start of the document
* `readers` - Number of people reading the document
* `capacity` - Number of words to read during the session
* `query` - Derpibooru query to insert images between chunks
